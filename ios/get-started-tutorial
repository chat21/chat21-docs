# Get started tutorial
**Your first iOS App with Chat21 SDK**

## Introduction

With this tutorial you will learn how to create a fully functional chat as a Single View Application.

The full code of this tutorial is available on GitHub:

[DOWNLOAD SOURCE CODE](https://github.com/chat21/chat21-get-started-ios)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you first need to set up your environment:

1.  Xcode 9.0 or later
2.  An Xcode project targeting iOS 9 or above
3.  The bundle identifier of your app
4.  **Firebase project**. Create one free on  [https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com/)
5.  **Firebase functions**. Install  [**Chat21 cloud functions**](https://github.com/chat21/chat21-cloud-functions) on your just created Firebase project. This is the “backend” of the chat. Installation instructions are available [here](https://github.com/chat21/chat21-cloud-functions)

## Configure authentication

Enable **email signin** in Firebase console:

Create a user to test chat functions:

Choose email and password:

Add the user with “ADD USER” button.

## Create the Xcode project

This first tutorial will focus on the creation of a simple  **single view application**. In the next (upcoming) tutorial we will approach the creation of a more realistic  **multi tab application**  (similar to Whatsapp).

First open Xcode, select File > New > Project and choose Single View App:

Insert the project info using **MyChat** as project name and insert your team:

## Create the Firebase iOS App

Switch on project on Firebase, go to the _Firebase Console_ > _Project Overview_ and add a **iOS App** to your project by clicking on “Add iOS App” and follow the setup steps.

When prompted, enter your app’s bundle ID. It’s important to enter the bundle ID your app is using, this can only be set when you add an app to your Firebase project.

At the end, you’ll download a **GoogleService-Info.plist file**. You can download this file again at any time.

Now add this file to your Xcode project root using the Add Files utility in Xcode (from the File menu, click Add Files). Make sure the file is included in your app’s build target.

## Add Firebase libs to the project

Now go back to your Xcode project and add firebase libraries to your project.

We prefer CocoaPods to add Firebase libraries. If you use CocoaPods simply create a file named “Podfile” in the project’s root folder with the following content:

    platform :ios, '10.0'
    
    target 'MyChat' do
    
    pod 'NYTPhotoViewer'
    pod 'Firebase/Core'
    pod 'Firebase/Database'
    pod 'Firebase/Auth'
    pod 'Firebase/Messaging'
    pod 'Firebase/Storage'
    
    end

Close Xcode and run:

> **pod install**

From now on open the project using _MyChat.xcworkspace_ file.

NOTE: the complete guide to add Firebase libs to you project is available here:

[https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup)

## Install Chat21 libraries

Download the Chat21 libraries directly as zip archive from GitHub here:

[https://github.com/chat21/chat21-ios-sdk](https://github.com/chat21/chat21-ios-sdk)

Add the two folders:

-   Chat21Core
-   Chat21UI

to your Xcode project using the Add Files utility in Xcode (from the File menu, click Add Files). Make sure the folders are included in your app’s build target.

NOTE: we are currently developing a more useful pod distribution files.

## Get start with the UI

First remove the two files FirstViewController.{h,m} because we’ll use our chat’s conversations’s history as root View Controller.

Open **AppDelegate.m** adding the following import directives:

    #import "AppDelegate.h"
    #import "ChatManager.h"
    #import "ChatUIManager.h"
    #import "ChatUser.h"
    #import "ChatAuth.h"
    @import Firebase;
